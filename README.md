# CHS-FTC-CAD

Official GitHub repository with CAD resources for Cupertino High School's FTC teams.

Please keep this folder separate from your team's robot model. This repository is for part files only; teams should set up their own repositories as detailed below.

#Setting up GitHub with CAD

1. Create a new folder which will contain all your CAD files. We'll use "tinoftccad" as an example.

> tinoftccad

2. Create a subdirectory called "CHS-FTC-CAD" (you will be cloning this repository into this folder).

> tinoftccad

> 	CHS-FTC-CAD

3. Create a subdirectory called "FTC-(team number)-(year)-CAD". For example, team 7610 for the 2017-2018 season would use the name "FTC-7610-2018-CAD".

> tinoftccad

> 	CHS-FTC-CAD

> 	FTC-7610-2018-CAD

4. Clone CHS-FTC-CAD into the appropriate directory. You can use GitHub desktop for this step.

> tinoftccad
> 	CHS-FTC-CAD *(repository)*

> 		*(cad resources)*

> 	FTC-7610-2018-CAD

5. If a teammate of yours has already created a repository for your team's CAD files, clone it into the second folder. Otherwise, create a new repository in the second folder, and name it the same as the folder. GitHub desktop works for this too.

> tinoftccad

> 	CHS-FTC-CAD *(repository)*

> 		*(cad resources)*

> 	FTC-7610-2018-CAD *(repository)*

> 		*(your cad files)*

You can now pull updated CAD files shared between teams from CHS-FTC-CAD, and you can push and pull your team's CAD models to your team's repository. You're all set!
